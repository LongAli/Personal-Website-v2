      <div class = "title">Introduction</div>
      <p> As the economy is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,
        many companies show layoff, freeze hiring or even cancel
        their internships opportunities. Students need an alternative way to
         build their experience and resume to compete for the limited opportunities
         during and after this critical period. <br><br>
         Our team has developed an app that aims to <strong>empower and support job
         seekers with a collaborative project space to build their work
         experience</strong> and <strong>provide opportunities to directly connect with recruiters.</strong></p>

      <div class = "title">Research Question</div>
      <p>How might we design a platform in order to help college students
      <strong>improve their chances</strong> of getting a future
      job <strong>during and after</strong> the pandemic?
      </p>

      <div class = "title">My Role</div>
      <p>As the facilitator of the team, I kept the team in schedule by
        taking the initative to start and motivate other members to be
        more active and collaborate remotely via Zoom & Messenger.
        <br><br>Besides actively took part in each step, for UX part, my main responsbility was to
        analyze the survey and interview data, making the affinity map.
        I was also responsible for researching and making the secondary persona and the competitor analysis.
        For UI design, I settled the style guide and color theme of the app and was mainly
        responsible for the screens for the onboarding pages, search function and the profile & others.
      </p>


      <div class = "title">Secondary Research</div>
      <p>To start off, we performed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swU7iD3qMjBG3RTwx47FKm6EGOhadvoM6qjV-RW269g/edit?usp=sharing">
        online research</a> to understand the existing
        resources that faciliate communication and colloboration for remote
        studying and working. After that, we decided to focus on the job
        related perspective and observed <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/16DQZoiUWDG32sV9KV0wH2kqgII7s4afDvnKalUXEO-4/edit?usp=sharingonline">
        communities</a> where people share
        their recent experience: </p>
        <br>
        <img src="img/2st.png" alt="bluum-casestudy" width = 100%>
        <br><br>
      <p>To understand the circumstance from both perspectives, we also gathered information from the recruiters side.
      From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href= "https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephliu/2020/04/20/recruiters-share-9-mistakes-job-seekers-are-making-amid-the-coronavirus-pandemic/#6299c641ccba">
        the article by Joseph Liu for Forbes</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href= "https://www.ere.net/recruiting-in-a-pandemic-a-conversation-with-robin-schooling/">
          the video by Vadim Liberman& Robin Schooloing</a>, we concluded that:
      <ul>
        <li>Recruiter need to <strong>filter out unqualified applications</strong> more effectively due to mass application. </li>
        <li>Applicants need to<strong> be proactive</strong> and doing things relevant to their line of work.</li>
        <li>Candidates can <strong>expand their skills interdisciplinarily</strong> to be more competitive. </li>
        <li>Making <strong>connections with professionals</strong> will significantly increase the chance of getting hired. </li>
      </ul>

      <div class = "title">Primary Research</div>
      <p>We then sent out a survey to online communities to understand the users'
        pain points when seeking internships or
        jobs. From the 22 survey responses, we found out that: </p>
        <br>
        <img src="img/survey-bluum.png" alt="bluum-casestudy" width = 100%>

  <br>  <br>

          <p>From the 5 semi-structured <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yJMm0UE-EWTxKz9k5vLNEBXTqgZAu-LdTQuRcKvPmLc/edit?usp=sharingfull">interviews</a>,
            we broke the scripts into cards and reorganized them into an affinity map:</p>
<br>
          <img src="img/interview.png" alt="interview" width = 100%>
<br><br>
          <p>Representative quotes/interesting thoughts from interviews:</p>
<br>
          <img src="img/Interviewquote.png" alt="interview" width = 100%>

      <div class = "title">Insights</div>
      <p>After laying the groundwork, we narrowed down 3 main pain
        points that caused users‚Äô frustrations. They correspond to different
        stages during job hunting process.
        <br><br>
        It's important to note that all the steps
        are interwound, meaning that none of which is mutually exclusive.
        For the purpose of reducing the complex of tackling the problem and leaving
        more space to brainstorm various solutions for each, we roughly categorized them into:

      <br><br>Before job seeking: <strong>The Preparation Stage  </strong>
          <br>After job seeking: <strong>The Application Stage </strong>
          <br>Throughout job seeking: <strong>The "Get Connected" Stage </strong>

<br><br>
         Derived from there,
        we seeked design opportunites that were worthy to explore.</p>

      <div class = "title">Storyboard</div>
      <p>To explore as many potential solutions as possible, we came up with
        8 ‚Äúhow might we...‚Äù statements, and picked the one we thought as the
        most promising one to sketched out <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lt-tI-Opj8L2Mq5GWPLgPMdbkLQpyuOl-BvM0TByZ_k/edit?usp=sharing">

      <div class = "title">Competitor Analysis</div>
      <p>From the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mLQitcu4BXzDTJjrieLZ8LLvhG2KEjvFpLEkbAu51hA/edit?usp=sharingcompetitive">competitor analysis</a>, we realized that there are a lot of
        job/internship posting& applications platforms; however, there is
        a  <strong>limited number </strong> of platforms that provides opportunities for users
        to build  <strong>hand-on work experience and enrich career related skills</strong>.
<br><br>
        And for rograms and/or forums that help people gain hand-on experience
        by working together in groups, they are <strong>not really effective at helping
        people to connect and lack important features that support group-work
        such as collaborative workspace</strong>.
<br><br>
        Hence we want to create an app that dedicates to helping users to
        <strong>connect with others to work on hand-on projects</strong>.</p>

          As for project management, we use more concrete color blocks to
        help users better focus on the task they need to do</p>

      <div class = "title">Takeaways</div>
<p>
      <strong style = "font-size:18pt;">Find root causes</strong><br><br>
      <p>We got feedback on how people think the concepts of the app are very relatable
      and that they will definitely use the app like this to connect with others and start projects.
      It makes me realize that it's pivotal to <strong>anchor the most urgent problem
      in the first place</strong> for the following design to work well. <br><br>For instance,
      in both survey and interview response, we also got many responses concerning respondants' emotional
      states and it turned out that many groups had explored the idea of relaxing and alleviating mental stress.
      But we studied deeper and figured <strong>the root causes</strong> that people were anxious
      and unmotivated <strong>because of the cancellation of their internships and that they feel unqualified
        due to lack of connections and experience</strong>.
      With those root causes in mind, we divergently thought of solutions from different stages including
      improving skills, getting connections, and applying for jobs. Taking advantage of spotting the right problem and
      ideating various ideas, our project stands out.<br><br><br>

      <strong style = "font-size:18pt;">Embrace uncertainty and justify changes</strong><br><br>
      <p>As shown in the iterative design process, our design has gone through several versions
       and sometimes the content/function of the pages has completely changed. As a team, we discussed
       those uncertainties carefully while keeping the user need in mind. With reasonable justification,
       we made improvements.
