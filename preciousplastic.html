    <p> It's a 12 weeks long side project led by <a href = "https://designlab.ucsd.edu/eric-hekler-joins-design-lab-team/">
    Prof. Eric Hekler</a> and <a href = "https://impactmill.co/pages/about-us">Prof. Andrew Krause</a> from UCSD Design Lab.
    While the engineering team focus on building and improving the injection
    machine, solving all the technical problems,
    <strong>the design team that I was in aim for a broader vision on how to build a sustainable
    and healthy recycling and remaking ecosystem here at San Diego that help
    unstuck people who also share the same goal as Precious Plastic.</strong></p>

    <div class = "title">What‚Äôs Precious Plastic?</div>
    <p>Started in 2013 by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hakkens">Dave Hakkens</a>,
    Precious Plastic project builds an open plastic recycling community where <strong>EVERYONE</strong>
    can join to <strong>recycle, remake and reuse</strong> plastic.
    Now, Precious Plastic has 300+ workspaces worldwide. It provides blueprints
    for machines and molds along with business starterkit.
<br><br>
    Within the <a href="https://preciousplastic.com/index.html">Precious Plastic Universe</a>,
    people can decide to join in different
     roles to contribute based on their time and resources.</p><br>

    <div class = "title">Why Precious Plastic?</div>

      <p>Instead of asking why, we should think about <strong>

        <div id = "content">
          <p> We also sent out a survey to the online UCSD community to
            understand how students respond to the recycling ideas and workspaces.
          And we were able to refine our market size and better empathzied with their needs </p>
    <img src="ppimg/marketsurvey.png" alt="interviewdata" width = 100%;>
    <div class = "title">Challenges</div>
    <p>Going back to the bigger picture, our main question to solve is that:<br><br></p>
    <p style = "font-size: 24pt; color:#7197D0">  How might we help people get unstuck on recycling plastic?</p>

  <br><br><p>From the interviews with existing PP members, we learned that the lack of various
      resources including financial, human power, technical knowledge,
      business promotion etc. is what get they stuck. <br>As the data came from
      worldwide(including two from California), <strong>it‚Äôs safe to assume that people
      who are interested in recycling plastic here at San Diego are also facing such obstacles</strong>.
  <br><br>
      Meanwhile, we are also working with <strong>TECHNICAL constraint</strong> of
      having responsbilitythe injection machine, <strong>SAFETY constraint</strong> of potential harmful gas
     as well as <strong>FINANCIAL AND HUMANPOWER constraint</strong> of building molds.

  <br><br>
      Therefore,
      <strong>primary target audiences would be mainly early adopters</strong> of repurposed plastic idea.
      More specific, they are college students who are interested in eco-friendly
      creation process and products(The 44.2%) as well as local crafters who
      are interested in recycling plastic on their own.


    <div class = "title">What we are trying to do...</div>
    <p> is that we are trying to build an ecosystem of recycling plastic that is sustainable,
      accessible and affordable for everyone to take part in. </p>

    <div class = "title">The Ongoing Process</div>
    <p>We have explored different aspects of the project and were trying to
      set up a framework for future designers and potential colloboration orgs to continue the work.</p>
